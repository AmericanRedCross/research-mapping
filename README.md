# Reference Center Research Mapping

To add more logos, the image file goes in [`research-mapping/img/logos`](https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/research-mapping/tree/gh-pages/img/logos)
and the [`url.csv`](https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/research-mapping/blob/gh-pages/img/logos/urls.csv) file in that folder needs to be updated with the filename and URL for the organization's website.
